# MetroRouteFinder
A Java console application to find shortest metro routes in Hyderabad using Dijkstra and BFS algorithms.
Hyderabad Metro Route Finder (Java Console App)

This is a Java console-based application that simulates the Hyderabad Metro system and helps users find the shortest route between stations using **Dijkstra's algorithm** (by distance) and **BFS** (by number of stations).

## Features

- Simulates Hyderabad Metro with 3 lines: Red, Blue, Green
- Users can:
  - Find shortest route using **Dijkstra (by cost)** or **BFS (by stations)**
  - View all available stations
  - Detect **interchanges between metro lines**
- Simple **menu-based console interface**

## Technologies Used

- Java
- Core DSA: HashMap, ArrayList, Queue, PriorityQueue
- Algorithms: **Dijkstra**, **BFS**
- OOP Concepts: Classes, Objects, Encapsulation
